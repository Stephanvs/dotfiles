# benny

benny gives you two cursor automations for slack issue reports. one triages each report. the other reproduces confirmed bugs and may prepare a small draft fix.

the files in this directory are dormant setup and automation sources. they do not appear as slash skills.

## set it up

1. point cursor at [`FOR_AGENTS.md`](./FOR_AGENTS.md) and name the target repository.
2. let setup merge this whole directory into the target at `.cursor/automations/benny/`. it must preserve destination-only files and review conflicts instead of overwriting local edits.
3. let setup enable pstack in the target repository's `.cursor/settings.json` for shared dependencies:

```json
{
	"plugins": {
		"pstack": { "enabled": true }
	}
}
```

4. keep user-owned configuration outside the copied pack, for example in `.cursor/benny/`. adapt [`configuration.example.yaml`](./templates/configuration.example.yaml) and [`feature-map.example.md`](./skills/reproduce-and-fix-issues/references/feature-map.example.md).
5. commit `.cursor/settings.json`, `.cursor/automations/benny/`, and any secret-free configuration before enabling either automation.
6. review each new automation draft or update existing automations in their editors. then send a harmless test report and verify every source-channel post stays in the original thread.
