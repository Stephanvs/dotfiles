## Decision Tree: Which File to Load?

Use this to route to the correct file without loading all content:

```
├─ "How do I enable/configure X?"           → configuration.md
├─ "What's the API/method/binding for X?"   → api.md
├─ "How do I implement X pattern?"          → patterns.md
│   ├─ Usage tracking/billing               → patterns.md
│   ├─ Error tracking                       → patterns.md
│   ├─ Performance monitoring               → patterns.md
│   ├─ Multi-tenant tracking                → patterns.md
│   ├─ Tail Worker filtering                → patterns.md
│   └─ OpenTelemetry export                 → patterns.md
└─ "Why isn't X working?" / "Limits?"       → gotchas.md
```

## Reading Order

Load files in this order based on task:

| Task Type | Load Order | Reason |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| **Initial setup** | configuration.md → gotchas.md | Setup first, avoid pitfalls |
| **Implement feature** | patterns.md → api.md → gotchas.md | Pattern → API details → edge cases |
| **Debug issue** | gotchas.md → configuration.md | Common issues first |
| **Query data** | api.md → patterns.md | API syntax → query examples |
