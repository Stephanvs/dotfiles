## Quick Start

Cloudflare Realtime SFU: WebRTC infrastructure on global network (310+ cities). Anycast routing, no regional constraints, pub/sub model.

**Core concepts:**
- **Sessions:** WebRTC PeerConnection to Cloudflare edge
- **Tracks:** Audio/video/data channels you publish or subscribe to
- **No rooms:** Build presence layer yourself via track sharing (see patterns.md)

**Mental model:** Your client establishes one WebRTC session, publishes tracks (audio/video), shares track IDs via your backend, others subscribe to your tracks using track IDs + your session ID.

## Choose Your Approach

| Approach | When to Use | Complexity |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **PartyTracks** | Production apps with device switching, React | Low - Observable-based, handles reconnections |
| **Raw API** | Custom requirements, non-browser, learning | Medium - Full control, manual WebRTC lifecycle |
| **RealtimeKit** | End-to-end SDK with UI components | Lowest - Managed state, React hooks |

**Recommendation:** Start with PartyTracks for most production applications. See patterns.md for PartyTracks examples.

## SFU vs RealtimeKit

- **Realtime SFU:** WebRTC infrastructure (this reference). Build your own signaling, presence, UI.
- **RealtimeKit:** SDK layer on top of SFU. Includes React hooks, state management, UI components. Part of Cloudflare AI platform.

Use SFU directly when you need custom signaling or non-React framework. Use RealtimeKit for faster development with React.

## Setup
